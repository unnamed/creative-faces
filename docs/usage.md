## Usage

`creative-faces` cannot be used by itself, you must use a supported placeholder
system like [MiniPlaceholders](https://github.com/MiniPlaceholders/MiniPlaceholders)
or [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI). You can also use
the developers API.

How to use:
- Download `creative-central`, `creative-faces` and your favorite placeholders plugin
- Use the `%faces_face%` placeholder anywhere
- Done!

### Configuration

In the `config.yml` file you can set:
- The characters you want to use for the plugin.
- The font
- The namespace

Everything is configurable!

### Commands

There is only one command: `/faces`. It reloads the plugin configuration and
re-generates the resource-pack. The permission to use this command is `creativefaces.reload`
