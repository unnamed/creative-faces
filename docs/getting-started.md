## creative-faces

Welcome to the `creative-faces` documentation, creative-faces is a plugin
to allow Minecraft servers to show the face of a player in the chat. `creative-faces`
uses [creative](https://unnamed.team/docs/creative), *the library for resource-packs*, and
[creative-central](https://unnamed.team/docs/creative-central), *the plugin that unifies resource-packs*

`creative-faces` supports multiple placeholder systems like [MiniPlaceholders](https://github.com/MiniPlaceholders/MiniPlaceholders)
and [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI)
